Project Description

Our project is a Phishing Detection System that identifies malicious URLs using Machine Learning. It helps users verify whether a given URL is legitimate or a phishing attempt, providing a security layer against online threats.

The Problem statement


Phishing is a cyber-attack where malicious actors deceive users by creating fraudulent websites to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or personal information. Traditional blacklist-based detection methods fail to catch newly generated phishing URLs, necessitating intelligent, real-time detection¬†mechanisms.


The Solution
Solution Approach
To address this issue, we developed an AI-powered phishing URL detection system using machine learning. The system is implemented as a Flask-based API that:

Extracts URL Features:

Analyzes various characteristics of the URL, including length, domain attributes, special character usage, and keyword presence.
Uses a custom feature extraction function to generate a 50-dimensional feature vector.
Trains a Machine Learning Model:

Uses a Random Forest Classifier for classification.
If a trained model is unavailable, the system automatically trains a new one.
Deploys as an API:

The Flask API accepts a URL input via a POST request.
The extracted features are passed to the trained model for prediction.
Returns a binary classification result indicating whether the URL is phishing (1) or legitimate (0).

This is the user interface of a Phishing URL Detector web application. The design features a gradient background with a clean, centered input box.

üîç Functionality:

Users can enter a URL into the text box.
Clicking the "Check Legitimacy" button will analyze the URL to determine whether it's safe or a phishing attempt.
üé® Design:

A soft pink-blue gradient gives a modern look.
A rounded input field ensures a smooth user experience.
The button is styled in orange for visibility.
üõ°Ô∏è Purpose:
This tool helps users stay safe online by detecting suspicious links before clicking on them!
